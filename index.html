        <center>FAQ</center>
      </h2>
      <p class="questions-faq">
        How is this different to other site builders or OneNote?
      </p>

      <p class="answers-faq">
        Edufoliosâ„¢ is not actually a site builder. <span style="color: #ff8a73;"> <b>We WILL build your portfolio for you </span></b> (in under 10 seconds I might add) but we do far more than make â€˜pretty sitesâ€™ (oh yesâ€¦ weâ€™ve heard that one before).
        Our Subscribers enjoy the fact that they
        <span style="color: #ff8a73;"> <u>donâ€™t have to worry about building a site.</u></span> Youâ€™re not being assessed on your site building capabilities anyway! We help you <span style="color: #ff8a73;"> <b><i>get to reflecting, curating, and
              celebrating your impact straight away</i></b></span> â€“ no site building (or set up) required.
        <br>
        <br />
        I have lost track of the amount of people who have come to me and told me how many hours, stress and tears they have wasted trying to build a website to demonstrate their impact in their classroom. Theyâ€™re losing time with their families,
        their friends and time to get on with the actual process of reflection and they havenâ€™t even got to the evidence part yet!
      </p>

      <p class="questions-faq">
        I've only just started my degree / career is now the right time?
      </p>

      <p class="answers-faq">
        There is absolutely no pre-requisite of time for beginning your portfolio. In fact, the earlier you start, the easier itâ€™s going to be when itâ€™s time to compile it for assessment or accreditation. The more evidence you have, the more
        celebrating and growth youâ€™re going to experience. Edufolios â„¢ <span style="color: #ff8a73;"> will guide you to turn your reflections</span> about whatâ€™s been happening in your lectures, workshops, professional learning, classroom or site
        <span style="color: #ff8a73;"><b>into powerful pieces of evidence with the
            right artefacts.</b></span> We work with teachers at every career stage â€“ <span style="color: #ff8a73;">Graduate, Proficient, Highly Accomplished or Lead. </span>
      </p>

      <p class="questions-faq">
        How does Edufoliosâ„¢ help me work with the teaching standards?
      </p>

      <p class="answers-faq">
        Then, we give you a tool called the <span style="color: #ff8a73;"><i>Edufolios Standard Guide.</i></span> Itâ€™s there the whole time youâ€™re writing to help you to <span style="color: #ff8a73;"><b><u>select the right focus areas</b></u></span>,
        check you have<span style="color: #ff8a73;"><b><u>the right artefacts </b></u></span> and show you just how many of the standards youâ€™re really
        hitting with your practice. It even helps you to <span style="color: #ff8a73;">deepen your reflection </span>and see how you can <span style="color: #ff8a73;">improve your impact.</span> Itâ€™s amazing how much better that feels that way!
        <br>
        <br />
        When faced with the task of trying to meet 37 focus areas in each career stage (or 148 across all four career stages) it gets (pretty understandably) overwhelming! If you start with the standards and NOT your practice, youâ€™re moving in
        unchartered territory. The cognitive overload that creates causes so many people to run in the other direction for as long as possible! We get it!
        <br>
        <br />
        The truth is, youâ€™re already hitting those standards every time. Why? Because every time you teach, you will touch on something in the teaching standards. At Edufoliosâ„¢ we help you to flip the whole thing on itâ€™s head. We ask you to start
        with what youâ€™re doing already in your classroom, your uni. course or with your team. Not the standards. Back in the comfort zone!
      </p>

      <p class="questions-faq">
        I'm not very Technical. Will this be easy enough for me to use?
      </p>

      <p class="answers-faq">
        <span style="color: #ff8a73;">Teaching is hard enough! Weâ€™re not here to make it harder</span> â€“ we promise. In fact, Edufoliosâ„¢ is designed to be <span style="color: #ff8a73;">super user friendly</span>. You donâ€™t have to build a website.
        Weâ€™re going to do that for you! If you get stuck, at any stage, you can
        simply reach out to our very friendly support staff who will help you. Weâ€™ve even got a <b>detailed knowledge base</b> waiting for you. <span style="color: #ff8a73;">Check it out now</span> if you like.<span style="color: #ff8a73;"> Drop us
          an email</span> if you have any questions.

      <p class="questions-faq">
        Can I get my Money Back if I'm not Happy?
      </p>

      <p class="answers-faq">
        <span style="color: #ff8a73;"> Edufoliosâ„¢ is a subscription</span> based service. It work just like Netflix. You sign up and, after your trial, we start taking payment. You can choose to <span style="color: #ff8a73;">cancel your membership at
          anytime</span>. If you decided to take a break from Edufolios, (maternity
        leave, contracts etc.) we will keep your information safe and secure until youâ€™re ready to come back and build on it again. Just sign back up and pick up where you left off!
        <br>
        <br />
        <i>Itâ€™s cheaper to sign up for a year. But, if youâ€™re not sure, weâ€™d advise starting with a monthly subscription and then swapping over later. That way, you give yourself the chance to stop payments on a month by month basis.</i>
      </p>

      <p class="questions-faq">
        What have you done to make sure my data is safe?
      </p>

      <p class="answers-faq">
        <span style="color: #ff8a73;"><b>Edufoliosâ„¢ stores all of itâ€™s data in Australia.</b></span> As a result, your evidence, reflections, artefacts and data are all protected by<span style="color: #ff8a73;"> Australian privacy laws</span> and
        always remains in Australia. Our entire system is protected by a <span style="color: #ff8a73;">powerful firewall</span>
        that is specifically designed to prevent malicious attacks. Weâ€™ve even <span style="color: #ff8a73;">encrypted</span> the data as it moves back and forth between us and you. The database that holds it all, when youâ€™re not working on it, is
        also encrypted and is only accessible
        by our trained staff. Weâ€™re built on top of Amazon Web Services and use a clever system of <span style="color: #ff8a73;">self-healing servers</span> all so that we can <span style="color: #ff8a73;">prevent outages</span> and make sure you
        have access to your data at all times.
